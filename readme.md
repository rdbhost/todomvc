## Helping you select an MV\* framework


Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV\* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.

The TodoMVC project was created to help solve this problem of choice - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in many of the popular JavaScript MV\* frameworks of today.

This fork of the TodoMVC project has its own objective, to show implementation examples of Rdbhost.com.

Rdbhost.com allows an entire shared-data application to be implemented in the browser.  SQL queries can be embedded in the JavaScript and submitted to the server for execution.  Yes, it is safe, read the site for details about the white-list system.

TodoMVC apps for a few of the more popular frameworks have been reimplemented for Rdbhost.com.

#### Todo apps are included for:

- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)
- [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com)
- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
- [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com) (MVVM)
- [CanJS](http://canjs.us)

###### Non-framework Implementations

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## Live demos

TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.

It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.


## Project Status

TodoMVC 1.0 includes re-writes of almost all applications, ensuring they follow a consistent set of specifications and are using the latest versions of all libraries and frameworks in use. We've also addressed framework author concerns about routing by adding this to many of the more mainstream applications in the project.


## Getting Involved

Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.
